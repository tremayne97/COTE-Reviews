Installed via Package Manager Console.
(Least I would have -I'm already on version 6.0.3, which is backwards compatible!)

Data Migrations:
Added first migration in package manager console via:
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations
(You must navigate to the directory of your API project inside your solution first).

-Edited InitialCreate migration cs file to add table constraints.

Created the database:
Ran the following:
dotnet ef database update
via package manager console
This will update the existing database with our new migration, or create a new one if we don't already have one.

**Install the SQLite/SQL Server Compact ToolBox extension in Visual Studio to be able to view the database**

Created DbInitializer class with some data.
Edited Program class to ensure our migrations execute at startup.
dotnet watch run
-> If this adds an empty database, remake it using the five dotnet  terminal commands in EditDatabase file attached!

Added ReviewsController
Added UsersController
